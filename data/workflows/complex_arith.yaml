# Workflow: Arithmetic Chain
# ==========================
# Chain: add(4, 35) → multiply(_, 2) → subtract(_, 10)
# Each step takes previous output as first arg, param as second.

workflow: "Arithmetic chain: (4+35)*2-10"

inputs:
  x: "4"
  y: "35"

steps:
  - add:
      x: "$x"
      y: "$y"
  - multiply:
      y: "2"
  - subtract:
      y: "10"
