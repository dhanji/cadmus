# NL Lexicon — Earley parser vocabulary
# ======================================
# Drives the grammar's terminal symbols. Each category maps words to
# canonical labels. The Earley parser classifies input tokens by looking
# them up in these categories.
#
# Categories correspond to grammar terminal symbols:
#   verb, noun, preposition, possessive, determiner, ordering,
#   quantifier, conjunction, path_noun, filler

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Verbs: action words → abstract action labels (NOT cadmus ops)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Three domains:
#   1. File operations — copy, move, compress, encrypt, backup, etc.
#   2. General programming — build, compile, test, run, debug, lint, etc.
#   3. Git operations — commit, pull, push, merge, rebase, etc.
#
# RULE: every synonym must appear in EXACTLY ONE verb entry.
#       No word may be a synonym of two different actions.
#       Single-word synonyms only (tokenizer splits on whitespace).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Phrase groups: multi-word verb phrases → canonical single verb token
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Each entry defines content words (the skeleton) that must appear in order.
# Intervening stopwords/fillers (a, the, me, up, out, etc.) are stripped
# during matching. The canonical token replaces the entire phrase in the
# token stream before Earley parsing.
#
# Example: "make a list" → skeleton [make, list] → canonical "list"
#          "make me a list" → same match (me, a are stopwords)
#          "make me up a list" → same match (me, up, a are stopwords)
#
# RULE: skeletons must have 2+ content words.
#       The canonical token must be a known verb in the verbs section.
