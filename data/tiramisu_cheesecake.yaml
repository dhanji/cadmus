uncertainties:
  - axis: texture
    text: "Texture varies enormously by recipe and regional style — Japanese cheesecake is as light as tiramisu, and some tiramisu recipes are quite dense."
  - axis: flavor_profile
    text: "Flavor perception is subjective and influenced by cultural palate; sweetness thresholds vary significantly across populations."

    text: "No-bake cheesecake variants eliminate the technical difficulty gap, making preparation complexity recipe-dependent rather than inherent."
  - axis: cultural_origin
    text: "Ancient 'cheesecakes' bear little resemblance to modern versions; claiming continuity over 2,000 years may overstate the connection."
  - axis: versatility
    text: "Tiramisu's perceived inflexibility may reflect cultural conservatism rather than genuine technical limitation."
  - axis: presentation
    text: "Presentation is heavily context-dependent: a rustic family-style tiramisu and a plated restaurant cheesecake serve different aesthetic goals."
