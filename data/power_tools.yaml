# Fact Pack: Developer Power Tools
# ==================================
# DESIGN PRINCIPLE: Zero cross-entity contamination.
# Every claim, evidence item, property, and uncertainty is scoped to
# exactly ONE entity on ONE axis. The engine derives all comparisons.
#
# Entity groups for meaningful comparison:
#   1. tmux vs screen (terminal multiplexers)
#   2. ripgrep vs grep vs ag (text search — three-way)
#   3. jq vs yq (structured data query)
#   4. awk vs sed (stream processing)
#   5. git (solo — rich axis coverage, no direct peer)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Uncertainties
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
uncertainties:
  - axis: performance
    text: "Performance benchmarks vary significantly by workload, file size, regex complexity, and hardware. Results should be interpreted as relative, not absolute."

  - axis: composability
    text: "Composability depends on the specific pipeline context. A tool that excels in one workflow may be awkward in another."

  - axis: learning_curve
    text: "Learning difficulty is subjective and depends on prior experience. A developer familiar with Vim may find tmux trivial."

  - axis: ecosystem
    text: "Ecosystem richness changes over time. Screen's decline and ripgrep's rise illustrate how community momentum shifts."

  - axis: platform_support
    text: "Platform support ratings assume standard package managers. Exotic or embedded systems may have different availability."
