# Closest Pair of Points (Divide and Conquer)
# =============================================
# Find the two points with minimum Euclidean distance among n points.
#
# Time:  O(n log n) — divide and conquer
# Space: O(n)
#
# Algorithm:
#   1. Sort points by x-coordinate
#   2. Divide into left and right halves
#   3. Recursively find closest pair in each half: d_L, d_R
#   4. d = min(d_L, d_R)
#   5. Check strip of width 2d around the dividing line:
#      - Sort strip points by y-coordinate
#      - For each point, check at most 7 subsequent points
#   6. Return minimum of d and any closer pair in the strip
#
# Brute force: O(n²). The strip check is O(n) because each point
# compares with at most 7 others (geometric packing argument).
#
# Example: points = (2,3) (12,30) (40,50) (5,1) (12,10) (3,4)
#   Closest pair: (2,3) and (3,4), distance = √2
