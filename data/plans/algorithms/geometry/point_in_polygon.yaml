# Point-in-Polygon (Ray Casting Algorithm)
# =========================================
# Determine whether a point lies inside, outside, or on the boundary
# of a polygon. Cast a ray from the point to infinity and count how
# many polygon edges it crosses.
#
# Time:  O(n) where n = number of polygon edges
# Space: O(1)
#
# Algorithm:
#   crossings = 0
#   for each edge (v₁, v₂) of the polygon:
#     if ray from point crosses edge:
#       crossings += 1
#   if crossings is odd: point is inside
#   if crossings is even: point is outside
#
# Edge crossing test:
#   Ray goes rightward from (px, py).
#   Edge from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) crosses if:
#     - y1 and y2 straddle py (one above, one below)
#     - The x-coordinate of the intersection is > px
#
# Also known as the Jordan curve theorem test.
# Alternative: winding number algorithm (handles self-intersecting polygons).

  steps:
    # Cast horizontal ray from point, count edge crossings.
    # Odd crossings = inside, even = outside.
