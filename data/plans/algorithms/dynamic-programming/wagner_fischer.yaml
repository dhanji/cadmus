#
# Wagner-Fischer Algorithm
# ========================
# Tabular DP computation of the Levenshtein edit distance.
# Named after Robert Wagner and Michael Fischer (1974).
# This is the standard implementation of Levenshtein distance.
#
# Time:  O(m × n)
# Space: O(m × n); O(min(m,n)) with two-row optimization
#
# Algorithm:
#   Create (m+1) × (n+1) matrix D
#   D[i][0] = i for all i (delete i chars from s1)
#   D[0][j] = j for all j (insert j chars into s1)
#   for i in 1..m:
#     for j in 1..n:
#       cost = 0 if s1[i] == s2[j] else 1
#       D[i][j] = min(
#         D[i-1][j] + 1,        # deletion
#         D[i][j-1] + 1,        # insertion
#         D[i-1][j-1] + cost    # substitution
#       )
#   return D[m][n]
#
# Example: "sunday" → "saturday" = 3
