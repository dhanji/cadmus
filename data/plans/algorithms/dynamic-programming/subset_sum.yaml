# Subset Sum Problem
# ==================
# Given a set of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists
# a subset whose elements sum to the target.
#
# Time:  O(n × target) pseudo-polynomial DP
# Space: O(target) with 1D DP
#
# Algorithm (DP):
#   dp[0] = true
#   dp[j] = false for j > 0
#   for x in set:
#     for j in target downto x:
#       dp[j] = dp[j] OR dp[j - x]
#   return dp[target]
#
# Example: set = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, target = 9
#   Subset {4, 5} sums to 9 → true
#
# NP-complete in general, but pseudo-polynomial DP is practical
# for moderate target values.

subset-sum:
  inputs:
    - set: "List(Number)"
    - target: "Number"
  steps:
    # DP: for each element, update reachable sums from target down to element.
    - list_new:
        elements: "3 34 4 12 5 2"
    # Target = 9. Subset {4, 5} = 9 → true.
