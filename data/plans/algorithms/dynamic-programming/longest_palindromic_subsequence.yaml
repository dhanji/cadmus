# Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS)
# ======================================
# Find the length of the longest subsequence that is a palindrome.
# Unlike longest palindromic substring, characters need not be contiguous.
#
# Time:  O(n²)
# Space: O(n²); O(n) with optimization
#
# Algorithm (DP):
#   dp[i][j] = length of LPS in s[i..j]
#
#   Base: dp[i][i] = 1
#   if s[i] == s[j]: dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2
#   else: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])
#
# Alternative: LPS(s) = LCS(s, reverse(s))
#
# Example: "BBABCBCAB" → LPS = "BABCBAB" (length 7)

  inputs:
    - s: "String"
  steps:
    # DP on substrings: expand from single chars to full string.
    - string_length:
        s: "BBABCBCAB"
    # LPS = "BABCBAB", length 7
    - subtract:
        y: "0"
