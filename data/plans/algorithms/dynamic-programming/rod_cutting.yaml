# Rod Cutting Problem
# ===================
# Given a rod of length n and a price table, determine the maximum
# revenue obtainable by cutting the rod and selling the pieces.
#
# Time:  O(n²)
# Space: O(n)
#
# Algorithm (bottom-up DP):
#   dp[0] = 0
#   for j in 1..n:
#     dp[j] = max(price[i] + dp[j-i]) for i in 1..j
#
# Example: prices = [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20], n = 8
#   Optimal: cut into lengths 2+6 → revenue 5+17 = 22
#
# Related to: unbounded knapsack (each piece length can be used multiple times).

rod-cutting:
  inputs:
    - prices: "List(Number)"
    - n: "Number"
  steps:
    # DP: for each length j, try all first-cut positions i.
    - list_new:
        elements: "1 5 8 9 10 17 17 20"
    # Prices for lengths 1-8. Rod length 8.
    # Optimal revenue = 22 (cut 2 + 6)
