# Coin Change Problem
# ===================
# Given coin denominations and a target amount, find the minimum number
# of coins needed to make that amount. Classic DP problem.
#
# Time:  O(n × amount) where n = number of denominations
# Space: O(amount)
#
# Algorithm (dynamic programming):
#   dp[0] = 0
#   dp[i] = infinity for i > 0
#   for coin in coins:
#     for amount in coin..target:
#       dp[amount] = min(dp[amount], dp[amount - coin] + 1)
#   return dp[target]  (-1 if dp[target] == infinity)
#
# Example: coins = [1, 5, 10, 25], amount = 36
#   Optimal: 25 + 10 + 1 = 3 coins
#
# Greedy doesn't always work (e.g., coins=[1,3,4], amount=6: greedy=4+1+1=3, optimal=3+3=2)

coin-change:
  inputs:
    - coins: "List(Number)"
    - amount: "Number"
  steps:
    # DP: for each coin, update dp[amount] = min(dp[amount], dp[amount-coin]+1)
    - list_new:
        elements: "1 5 10 25"
    # Coins: 1 5 10 25; Target: 36
    # Minimum coins: 25 + 10 + 1 = 3 coins
