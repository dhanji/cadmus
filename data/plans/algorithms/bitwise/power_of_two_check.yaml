# Power of Two Check (Bit Trick)
# ===============================
# Determine if n is a power of 2 using a single bitwise operation.
#
# Time:  O(1)
# Space: O(1)
#
# Algorithm:
#   return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0
#
# Why it works: a power of 2 has exactly one bit set.
#   n     = 1000...0  (single 1-bit)
#   n - 1 = 0111...1  (all lower bits set)
#   n & (n-1) = 0     (no bits in common)
#
# Non-powers of 2 have multiple bits set, so n & (n-1) != 0.
#
# Examples:
#   16 = 10000₂, 15 = 01111₂ → 16 & 15 = 0 → power of 2 ✓
#   12 = 01100₂, 11 = 01011₂ → 12 & 11 = 8 → not power of 2 ✗

  inputs:
    - n: "Number"
  steps:
    # n & (n - 1) == 0 iff n is a power of 2 (and n > 0)
    - subtract:
        x: "16"
        y: "1"
    # 16 - 1 = 15. 16 AND 15 = 0 → 16 is a power of 2.
    - add:
        y: "0"
