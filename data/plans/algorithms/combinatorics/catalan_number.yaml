#
# Catalan Number
# ==============
# The nth Catalan number counts many combinatorial structures:
#   - Valid arrangements of n pairs of parentheses
#   - Number of full binary trees with n+1 leaves
#   - Number of paths in an n×n grid staying below the diagonal
#   - Number of triangulations of a polygon with n+2 sides
#
# Formula: C(n) = C(2n, n) / (n + 1) = (2n)! / ((n+1)! × n!)
# Recurrence: C(n) = Σ(i=0..n-1) C(i) × C(n-1-i), C(0) = 1
#
# Time:  O(n) with the direct formula
# Space: O(1)
#
# Sequence: 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, ...
#
# Example: C(5) = 42

  inputs:
    - n: "Number"
  steps:
    # C(n) = C(2n, n) / (n + 1)
    # C(5) = C(10, 5) / 6 = 252 / 6 = 42
    - multiply:
        x: "5"
        y: "2"
    # 2n = 10; C(10, 5) = 252
    - add:
        y: "0"
