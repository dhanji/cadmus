# Bellman-Ford Shortest Path
# ===========================
# Find shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices.
# Unlike Dijkstra, handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles.
#
# Time:  O(V × E)
# Space: O(V)
#
# Algorithm:
#   dist[v] = infinity for all v; dist[source] = 0
#   for i in 1..V-1:           # relax all edges V-1 times
#     for (u, v, w) in edges:
#       if dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
#         dist[v] = dist[u] + w
#   # Check for negative cycles
#   for (u, v, w) in edges:
#     if dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
#       negative cycle exists!
#
# Use when: graph has negative weights (Dijkstra fails).
# Slower than Dijkstra for non-negative weights.
