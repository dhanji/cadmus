# Floyd-Warshall All-Pairs Shortest Paths
# =========================================
# Compute shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted
# graph. Handles negative weights (but not negative cycles).
#
# Time:  O(V³)
# Space: O(V²)
#
# Algorithm:
#   dist[i][j] = weight(i, j) if edge exists, else infinity
#   dist[i][i] = 0
#   for k in 1..V:
#     for i in 1..V:
#       for j in 1..V:
#         dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])
#
# The key insight: at step k, dist[i][j] is the shortest path from i
# to j using only vertices {1, ..., k} as intermediates.
#
# Negative cycle detection: if dist[i][i] < 0 for any i after completion.
