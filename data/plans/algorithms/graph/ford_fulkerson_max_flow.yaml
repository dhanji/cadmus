# Ford-Fulkerson Maximum Flow
# ============================
# Find the maximum flow from source to sink in a flow network.
# Repeatedly find augmenting paths and push flow along them.
#
# Time:  O(E × max_flow) with DFS; O(V × E²) with Edmonds-Karp (BFS)
# Space: O(V + E) for the residual graph
#
# Algorithm:
#   Initialize flow = 0 on all edges
#   while there exists an augmenting path from source to sink in residual graph:
#     Find bottleneck (minimum residual capacity along path)
#     Augment flow along path by bottleneck
#     Update residual graph (forward edges decrease, backward edges increase)
#   return total flow
#
# Max-flow min-cut theorem: maximum flow = minimum cut capacity.
#
# Used in: network routing, bipartite matching, image segmentation.
