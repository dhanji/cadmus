#
# Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
# =========================
# Lossless data compression that replaces consecutive identical
# characters with a single character and its count.
#
# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(n) for the output
#
# Algorithm:
#   result = ""
#   i = 0
#   while i < n:
#     count = 1
#     while i + count < n and s[i + count] == s[i]:
#       count += 1
#     result += s[i] + str(count)
#     i += count
#
# Example: "AAABBBCCDDDDDD" → "A3B3C2D6"
# Decode: reverse the process — repeat each char by its count.
#
# Effective for data with many consecutive repeats (e.g., pixel rows).

run-length-encoding:
  inputs:
    - s: "String"
  steps:
    # Scan string, count consecutive identical characters.
    # Emit character + count pairs.
    - string_length:
        s: "AAABBBCCDDDDDD"
    # RLE output: "A3B3C2D6" (14 chars → 8 chars)
    - subtract:
        y: "0"
