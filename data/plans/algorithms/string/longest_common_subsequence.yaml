# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
# =================================
# Find the longest subsequence present in both strings. A subsequence
# is a sequence that appears in the same relative order but not
# necessarily contiguously.
#
# Time:  O(m × n)
# Space: O(m × n) for the DP table
#
# Algorithm (dynamic programming):
#   dp[i][j] = length of LCS of s1[0..i] and s2[0..j]
#
#   if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:
#     dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
#   else:
#     dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
#
#   Backtrack from dp[m][n] to reconstruct the LCS string.
#
# Example: LCS("ABCBDAB", "BDCAB") = "BCAB" (length 4)
