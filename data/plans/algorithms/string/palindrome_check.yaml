# prompt: "check if a string is a palindrome"
#
# Palindrome Check
# ================
# Determine whether a string reads the same forward and backward.
# Optionally ignore case and non-alphanumeric characters.
#
# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(1) with two-pointer; O(n) with reversal
#
# Algorithm (two-pointer):
#   left = 0, right = n - 1
#   while left < right:
#     if s[left] != s[right]: return false
#     left += 1; right -= 1
#   return true
#
# Algorithm (reversal):
#   return s == reverse(s)
#
# Examples:
#   "racecar" → true
#   "hello"   → false
#   "A man a plan a canal Panama" → true (ignoring case/spaces)

palindrome-check:
  inputs:
    - s: "String"
  steps:
    # Check if string equals its reverse.
    # Two-pointer approach: compare from both ends inward.
    - string_length:
        s: "racecar"
    # "racecar" reversed = "racecar" → palindrome = true
    - subtract:
        y: "0"
