# Longest Common Substring
# ========================
# Find the longest string that is a contiguous substring of both input
# strings. Unlike LCS, characters must be consecutive.
#
# Time:  O(m × n)
# Space: O(m × n) for the DP table; O(min(m,n)) with rolling row
#
# Algorithm (dynamic programming):
#   dp[i][j] = length of longest common suffix of s1[0..i] and s2[0..j]
#
#   if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:
#     dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
#   else:
#     dp[i][j] = 0
#
#   max_len = max of all dp[i][j]
#   Backtrack from the position of max_len to extract the substring.
#
# Example: LCSubstr("ABABC", "BABCBA") = "BABC" (length 4)
