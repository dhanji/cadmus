#
# Caesar Cipher
# =============
# Substitution cipher that shifts each letter by a fixed number of
# positions in the alphabet. Named after Julius Caesar, who used
# a shift of 3.
#
# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(n) for the output
#
# Algorithm:
#   for each character c in plaintext:
#     if c is a letter:
#       shifted = (c - 'A' + shift) mod 26 + 'A'
#       output shifted
#     else:
#       output c  (non-letters unchanged)
#
# Example (shift=3): "HELLO" → "KHOOR"
# Decrypt: shift by (26 - shift), i.e., shift left.
#
# Trivially breakable (only 25 possible keys). Historical interest.

caesar-cipher:
  inputs:
    - plaintext: "String"
    - shift: "Number"
  steps:
    # Shift each letter by the given amount, wrapping at Z→A.
    # Non-alphabetic characters pass through unchanged.
    - string_length:
        s: "HELLO WORLD"
    # Caesar(3): "HELLO WORLD" → "KHOOR ZRUOG"
    - add:
        y: "3"
