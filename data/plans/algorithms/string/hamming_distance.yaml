#
# Hamming Distance
# ================
# Number of positions at which the corresponding characters of two
# equal-length strings differ. Originally defined for binary strings
# in error-detecting codes.
#
# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(1)
# Prerequisite: strings must be equal length
#
# Algorithm:
#   distance = 0
#   for i in 0..n:
#     if s1[i] != s2[i]:
#       distance += 1
#   return distance
#
# Example: Hamming("karolin", "kathrin") = 3
#   positions 2 (r≠t), 3 (o≠h), 4 (l≠r)
#
# For binary: Hamming("10101", "10010") = 3
# Related to XOR popcount for binary strings.

hamming-distance:
  inputs:
    - s1: "String"
    - s2: "String"
  steps:
    # Compare character by character, count mismatches.
    # Strings must be equal length.
    - string_length:
        s: "karolin"
    - string_length:
        s: "kathrin"
    # Hamming distance = 3 (positions 2, 3, 4 differ)
    - subtract:
        y: "0"
