#
# Damerau-Levenshtein Distance
# =============================
# Extension of Levenshtein distance that also allows transposition of
# two adjacent characters as a single edit operation.
#
# Operations: insertion, deletion, substitution, transposition
#
# Time:  O(m × n)
# Space: O(m × n)
#
# Algorithm:
#   Same as Levenshtein DP, plus:
#   if s1[i-1] == s2[j-2] and s1[i-2] == s2[j-1]:
#     dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-2][j-2] + 1)  # transposition
#
# Example: "CA" → "ABC"
#   Levenshtein: 3 (delete C, keep A, insert B, insert C)
#   Damerau-Levenshtein: 2 (transpose CA→AC, insert B)
#
# More accurate for typo correction (transpositions are common typos).

damerau-levenshtein:
  inputs:
    - s1: "String"
    - s2: "String"
  steps:
    # DP table with additional transposition check for adjacent characters.
    - string_length:
        s: "CA"
    - string_length:
        s: "ABC"
    # Damerau-Levenshtein distance = 2 (transpose + insert)
    - subtract:
        y: "0"
