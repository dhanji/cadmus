# Boyer-Moore Majority Vote
# =========================
# Find the element that appears more than n/2 times in an array.
# Uses a clever cancellation trick requiring only O(1) space.
#
# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(1)
#
# Algorithm:
#   candidate = None, count = 0
#   for x in array:
#     if count == 0:
#       candidate = x
#       count = 1
#     elif x == candidate:
#       count += 1
#     else:
#       count -= 1
#   # Verify: count occurrences of candidate (may not exist)
#   return candidate if count(candidate) > n/2 else None
#
# Intuition: the majority element "survives" all cancellations.
#
# Example: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2] → candidate = 2 (appears 4/7 times)
