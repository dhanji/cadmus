# Exponential Search
# ==================
# Find the range where the target lies by doubling the index
# (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...), then binary search within that range.
# Particularly useful for unbounded or infinite lists.
#
# Time:  O(log n)
# Space: O(1) iterative
# Prerequisite: sorted input
#
# Algorithm:
#   if list[0] == target: return 0
#   i = 1
#   while i < n and list[i] <= target:
#     i *= 2
#   # Binary search in range [i/2, min(i, n-1)]
#   return binary_search(list, target, i/2, min(i, n-1))
#
# Combines exponential probing with binary search.

exponential-search:
  inputs:
    - lst: "List(Number)"
    - target: "Number"
  steps:
    - list_new:
        elements: "2 3 4 10 40 50 60 70 80 90 100"
    # Exponential search: double index to find range, then binary search.
    # O(log n). Good for unbounded lists.
