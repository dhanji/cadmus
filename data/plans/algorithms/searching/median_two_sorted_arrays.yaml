# Median of Two Sorted Arrays
# ============================
# Find the median of the combined sorted array without merging them.
# Classic binary search problem.
#
# Time:  O(log(min(m, n)))
# Space: O(1)
#
# Algorithm:
#   Binary search on the smaller array to find partition point.
#   Partition both arrays such that:
#     left_count = (m + n + 1) / 2
#     max(left_partition) <= min(right_partition)
#
#   If m + n is odd: median = max(left_partition)
#   If even: median = (max(left) + min(right)) / 2
#
# Example: A = [1, 3], B = [2]
#   Merged: [1, 2, 3] → median = 2
#
# Example: A = [1, 2], B = [3, 4]
#   Merged: [1, 2, 3, 4] → median = 2.5

    - list_new:

    # A = [1,3,5,7], B = [2,4,6,8] → median = (4+5)/2 = 4.5
