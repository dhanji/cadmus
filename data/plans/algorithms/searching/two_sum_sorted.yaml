# Two Sum (Sorted Array — Two Pointer)
# =====================================
# Given a sorted array and a target sum, find two elements that add
# up to the target.
#
# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(1)
#
# Algorithm:
#   left = 0, right = n - 1
#   while left < right:
#     sum = arr[left] + arr[right]
#     if sum == target: return (left, right)
#     elif sum < target: left += 1
#     else: right -= 1
#   return None  # no pair found
#
# For unsorted arrays: use a hash set for O(n) time, O(n) space.
#
# Example: [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
#   2 + 15 = 17 > 9 → move right
#   2 + 11 = 13 > 9 → move right
#   2 + 7 = 9 → found! indices (0, 1)
