# prompt: "search for a number in a list using linear search"
#
# Linear Search (Sequential Search)
# ==================================
# Scan each element of the list from start to end until the target is
# found or the list is exhausted.
#
# Time:  O(n) worst and average; O(1) best
# Space: O(1)
# Prerequisite: none — works on unsorted data
#
# Algorithm:
#   for i in 0..n:
#     if list[i] == target: return i
#   return -1  # not found
#
# Simplest search. Use when data is small or unsorted.

linear-search:
  inputs:
    - lst: "List(Number)"
    - target: "Number"
  steps:
    - list_new:
        elements: "10 23 19 5 42 7 31"
    # Linear search: scan left to right until target found.
    # O(n). No sorting required.
