# Prime Factorization (Trial Division)
# =====================================
# Decompose a number into its prime factors.
#
# Time:  O(√n)
# Space: O(log n) for the factors
#
# Algorithm:
#   factors = []
#   d = 2
#   while d × d <= n:
#     while n mod d == 0:
#       factors.append(d)
#       n = n / d
#     d += 1
#   if n > 1: factors.append(n)
#   return factors
#
# Example: 360 = 2³ × 3² × 5 = [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5]
# Example: 97 = [97] (prime)
#
# For large numbers, use Pollard's rho or quadratic sieve.

prime-factorization:
  inputs:
    - n: "Number"
  steps:
    # Divide by 2, then odd numbers up to √n.
    - modulo:
        x: "360"
        y: "2"
    # 360 mod 2 = 0 → factor 2. Continue: 360 = 2³ × 3² × 5
    - add:
        y: "0"
