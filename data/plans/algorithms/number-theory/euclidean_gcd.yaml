#
# Euclidean GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
# ========================================
# Find the largest number that divides both a and b without remainder.
# Uses the property that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b).
#
# Time:  O(log(min(a, b)))
# Space: O(1) iterative
#
# Algorithm:
#   while b != 0:
#     a, b = b, a mod b
#   return a
#
# Example: gcd(48, 18)
#   48 mod 18 = 12 → gcd(18, 12)
#   18 mod 12 = 6  → gcd(12, 6)
#   12 mod 6  = 0  → gcd(6, 0) = 6

  inputs:
    - a: "Number"
    - b: "Number"
  steps:
    # Repeatedly replace (a, b) with (b, a mod b) until b = 0.
    - modulo:
        x: "48"
        y: "18"
    # 48 mod 18 = 12; continue: 18 mod 12 = 6; 12 mod 6 = 0 → GCD = 6
    - add:
        y: "0"
