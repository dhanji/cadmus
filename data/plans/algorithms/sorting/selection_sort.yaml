# prompt: "sort a list using selection sort"
#
# Selection Sort
# ==============
# Divide the list into sorted and unsorted regions. Repeatedly find
# the minimum element from the unsorted region and move it to the end
# of the sorted region.
#
# Time:  O(n²) in all cases
# Space: O(1) — in-place
# Stable: no (standard version)
#
# Algorithm:
#   for i in 0..n-1:
#     min_idx = i
#     for j in i+1..n:
#       if list[j] < list[min_idx]:
#         min_idx = j
#     swap(list[i], list[min_idx])
