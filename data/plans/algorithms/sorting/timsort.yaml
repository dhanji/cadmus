# Timsort: use Racket's built-in sort (which is a merge sort, similar to timsort)
# Example: sort (5 3 8 1 9 2 7 4 6) = (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
# expected: (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)

timsort:
  inputs:
    - lst: "List(Number)"
  bindings:
    lst: "(list 5 3 8 1 9 2 7 4 6)"
  steps:
    - sort_list:
        comparator: "<"
