# Bucket Sort
# ===========
# Distribute elements into a number of buckets, sort each bucket
# individually (using insertion sort or another algorithm), then
# concatenate the buckets.
#
# Time:  O(n + k) average when elements are uniformly distributed
#        O(n²) worst case (all elements in one bucket)
# Space: O(n + k) for k buckets
# Stable: yes (if sub-sort is stable)
#
# Algorithm:
#   create k empty buckets
#   for x in input:
#     insert x into bucket[floor(k × x / max_value)]
#   for each bucket:
#     sort(bucket)  # e.g., insertion sort
#   concatenate all buckets
