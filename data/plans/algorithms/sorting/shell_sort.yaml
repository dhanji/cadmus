# Shell Sort (Shellsort)
# ======================
# Generalization of insertion sort that allows exchange of items that
# are far apart. Uses a gap sequence that shrinks to 1, at which point
# it becomes a standard insertion sort on a nearly-sorted array.
#
# Time:  O(n^1.5) with Knuth's gap sequence; depends on gap choice
# Space: O(1) — in-place
# Stable: no
#
# Algorithm (Knuth gap sequence: 1, 4, 13, 40, 121, ...):
#   gap = 1
#   while gap < n/3: gap = gap * 3 + 1
#   while gap >= 1:
#     for i in gap..n:
#       # insertion sort with stride = gap
#       temp = list[i]
#       j = i
#       while j >= gap and list[j - gap] > temp:
#         list[j] = list[j - gap]
#         j -= gap
#       list[j] = temp
#     gap = gap / 3
