# prompt: "sort integers using counting sort"
#
# Counting Sort
# =============
# Non-comparison sort for integers in a known range [0, k].
# Count occurrences of each value, then reconstruct the sorted output
# from the counts.
#
# Time:  O(n + k) where k is the range of input values
# Space: O(k) for the count array
# Stable: yes (with careful output placement)
#
# Algorithm:
#   count = array of zeros, size k+1
#   for x in input:
#     count[x] += 1
#   output = []
#   for i in 0..k:
#     append i to output, count[i] times
#
# Only works for non-negative integers. Very fast when k is small.

    # Counting sort: count occurrences, reconstruct from counts.
    # O(n + k). Stable. Non-comparison based.
