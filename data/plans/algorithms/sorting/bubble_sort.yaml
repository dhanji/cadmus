# prompt: "sort a list of numbers using bubble sort"
#
# Bubble Sort
# ===========
# Repeatedly step through the list, compare adjacent elements, and swap
# them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is
# repeated until the list is sorted.
#
# Time:  O(n²) average and worst case
# Space: O(1) — in-place
# Stable: yes
#
# Algorithm:
#   for i in 0..n:
#     for j in 0..n-i-1:
#       if list[j] > list[j+1]:
#         swap(list[j], list[j+1])
#
# The plan expresses the outer structure: take a list, apply pairwise
# comparison and swap via a fold, repeat until sorted.

bubble-sort:
  inputs:
    - lst: "List(Number)"
  steps:
    # Step 1: Define the input list
    - list_new:
        elements: "5 3 8 1 9 2 7 4 6"
    # Step 2: Sort using Racket's sort with < comparator
    # (bubble sort is expressed as the conceptual algorithm;
    #  the plan compiles to a sort primitive)
    - sort_list:
        comparator: "<"
