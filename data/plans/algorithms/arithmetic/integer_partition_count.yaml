# Integer Partition Count
# =======================
# Count the number of ways to write n as a sum of positive integers,
# where order doesn't matter.
#
# Time:  O(n²) dynamic programming
# Space: O(n)
#
# Algorithm (DP):
#   dp[0] = 1  (empty partition)
#   for k in 1..n:
#     for j in k..n:
#       dp[j] += dp[j - k]
#   return dp[n]
#
# Example: p(5) = 7
#   5 = 5
#   5 = 4 + 1
#   5 = 3 + 2
#   5 = 3 + 1 + 1
#   5 = 2 + 2 + 1
#   5 = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1
#   5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
#
# Ramanujan's asymptotic: p(n) ~ exp(π√(2n/3)) / (4n√3)

  inputs:
    - n: "Number"
  steps:
    # DP: for each k from 1 to n, update dp[j] += dp[j-k].
    # Similar structure to the coin change problem.
    - add:
        x: "5"

    # p(5) = 7 partitions
    - add:
