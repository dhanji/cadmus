# Base Conversion
# ===============
# Convert a number from one base to another by repeated division.
#
# Time:  O(log_b(n)) where b = target base
# Space: O(log_b(n)) for the digits
#
# Algorithm (decimal to base b):
#   digits = []
#   while n > 0:
#     digits.prepend(n mod b)
#     n = n / b
#   return digits (or "" if n was 0)
#
# Algorithm (base b to decimal):
#   result = 0
#   for digit in digits:
#     result = result × b + digit
#
# Example: 42 in binary = 101010
#   42 / 2 = 21 r 0
#   21 / 2 = 10 r 1
#   10 / 2 = 5  r 0
#   5  / 2 = 2  r 1
#   2  / 2 = 1  r 0
#   1  / 2 = 0  r 1 → 101010

base-conversion:
  inputs:
    - n: "Number"
    - base: "Number"
  steps:
    # Repeated division: collect remainders in reverse order.
    - modulo:
        x: "42"
        y: "2"
    # 42 mod 2 = 0 (LSB). Continue dividing: 42 → 101010₂
    - add:
        y: "0"
