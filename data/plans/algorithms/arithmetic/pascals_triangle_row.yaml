# Pascal's Triangle Row
# =====================
# Row n of Pascal's triangle contains the binomial coefficients C(n, k)
# for k = 0, 1, ..., n. Each element is the sum of the two elements
# above it.
#
# Time:  O(n) per row
# Space: O(n) for one row
#
# Algorithm:
#   row = [1]
#   for k in 1..n:
#     row[k] = row[k-1] × (n - k + 1) / k
#   return row
#
# Row 0: [1]
# Row 1: [1, 1]
# Row 2: [1, 2, 1]
# Row 3: [1, 3, 3, 1]
# Row 4: [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
# Row 5: [1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1]
#
# Properties: symmetric, sum of row n = 2^n, diagonal = triangular numbers.
