# prompt: "compute the number of moves for the Tower of Hanoi"
#
# Tower of Hanoi
# ==============
# Move n disks from source peg to target peg using an auxiliary peg.
# Rules: only one disk at a time, never place larger on smaller.
#
# Time:  O(2^n) — exactly 2^n - 1 moves required
# Space: O(n) recursive stack
#
# Algorithm:
#   hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
#     if n == 1:
#       move disk 1 from source to target
#       return
#     hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
#     move disk n from source to target
#     hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)
#
# Move count: T(n) = 2^n - 1
# Example: T(3) = 7 moves, T(10) = 1023 moves, T(64) = 18446744073709551615
#
# Classic example of exponential-time recursion.

tower-of-hanoi:
  inputs:
    - n: "Number"
  steps:
    # Number of moves = 2^n - 1
    - expt:
        x: "2"
        y: "10"
    # 2^10 = 1024
    - subtract:
        y: "1"
    # 1024 - 1 = 1023 moves for 10 disks
