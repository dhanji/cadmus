# Collatz Sequence (3n + 1 Problem)
# ==================================
# Starting from any positive integer n, repeatedly apply:
#   if n is even: n = n / 2
#   if n is odd:  n = 3n + 1
# The conjecture states this always reaches 1.
#
# Time:  Unknown (no proven bound — the Collatz conjecture is unproven)
# Space: O(1) per step; O(k) to store the sequence
#
# Algorithm:
#   sequence = [n]
#   while n != 1:
#     if n is even: n = n / 2
#     else: n = 3 * n + 1
#     sequence.append(n)
#   return sequence
#
# Example (n=6): 6 → 3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1 (9 steps)
# Example (n=27): takes 111 steps, reaches max of 9232
#
# One of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.

collatz-sequence:
  inputs:
    - n: "Number"
  steps:
    # Apply the Collatz rule iteratively until reaching 1.
    # Even: divide by 2. Odd: multiply by 3 and add 1.
    - multiply:
        x: "6"
        y: "1"
    # Collatz(6): 6 → 3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
    - add:
        y: "0"
