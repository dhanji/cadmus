# prompt: "compute the factorial of a number"
#
# Factorial
# =========
# n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1
# By convention: 0! = 1
#
# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(1) iterative; O(n) recursive
#
# Algorithm (iterative):
#   result = 1
#   for i in 2..n:
#     result *= i
#   return result
#
# Stirling's approximation for large n:
#   n! ≈ √(2πn) × (n/e)^n
#
# Example: 10! = 3628800
# Growth: faster than exponential — n! > 2^n for n ≥ 4

factorial:
  inputs:
    - n: "Number"
  steps:
    # Multiply 1 × 2 × 3 × ... × n
    # Expressed as a fold over the range [1..n].
    - list_new:
        elements: "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
    # foldl with * and init=1: 1×2×3×...×10 = 3628800

        function: "*"
